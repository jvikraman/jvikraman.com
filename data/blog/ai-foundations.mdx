Notes from the `Oracle Certified 2024 AI Foundations Associate` certification course.

### AI vs ML vs DL

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** ➠ machines imitating human intelligence.

- **Machine Learning (ML)**

  - subset of AI that focuses on creating computer systems that can learn and improve from experience.
  - ML algorithms learn from past data and predict outcomes on new data and or identify trends on past data.
  - uses labeled data for training ML models.
  - use cases include `suggesting products while online shopping, movie suggestions, spam mail warning, self-driving cars etc.`

- **Deep Learning (DL)** ➠ algorithms that learn from complex data using `neural networks` and predict outcomes and or generate new data.

### Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning**

  - classify data and or make predictions.
  - learns relationships between input and output from `labeled data.`
  - use cases include `disease detection, weather forecasting, house price prediction, stock price prediction, spam detection, sentiment analysis, credit scoring etc.`
  - **Variations**

    - **Linear Regression**
      - used when the output label is `continuous` - e.g., house price predictor.
      - fits a straight line to the data.
      - **Loss** ➠ indicates how far the predicted value is from the actual value.
    - **Classification**
      - `supervised ML technique` used to categorize or assign data points into predefined classes based on their features or attributes. `Uses labeled dataset.`
      - used when the output label is `categorical` - e.g., spam detector.
        - **Binary** ➠ if prediction value is either true of false.
        - **Multi-class** ➠ for example, in sentiment analysis, prediction outputs are either positive, negative or neutral.
        - **Logistic Regression**
          - predicts `true or false` instead of something continuous such as house prices.
          - unlike linear regression, fits an `S-shaped curve called sigmoid function` to the data.

- **Unsupervised Learning**

  - type of ML that doesn't use any `labeled outputs.`
  - understands relationships within datasets and extracts trends from data. Can also learn patterns in the data and group similar data items.
  - use cases include `detecting fradulent transactions, customer segmentation, outlier detection, targeted marketing campaigns etc.`
  - **Clustering**
    - grouping of similar data items.
    - data items are more similar within a cluster than the items outside of it.
    - data items that are not similar within a cluster are termed as `outliers`.
    - use cases include `market segmentation, outlier analysis, recommendation systems etc.`
    - **Similarity** ➠ how close two data points are to each other - usually a value between 0 and 1.
    - **Clustering Workflow**
      - **prepare the data** ➠ remove missing values, normalize data, perform feature scaling etc.
      - **create similarity metrics** ➠ choose similarity metrics based on nature of data and clustering algorithm used - frequently used are `euclidean, hamm, manhattan, cosine etc.`
      - **run clustering algorithm** ➠ use the chosen similarity metrics to cluster the data - common algorithms used are `partition, hierarchical, density and distribution based.`
      - **interpret results and adjust clustering** ➠ check quality of clustering output by verifying against expectations iteratively.

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**

  - type of ML that enables an agent to learn from its interactions with the environment while receiveing feedback in the form of rewards or penalties without any labeled dataset.
  - makes decisions or choices and solves tasks by trial and error.
  - use cases include `industrial automation, autonomous vehicles, smart devices, gaming and entertainment, healthcare etc.`
  - **RL Terminologies**
    - **Agent** ➠ interacts with environment, takes actions and learns from feedback.
    - **Environment** ➠ external system with which the agent interacts.
    - **State** ➠ representation of the current situation of the environment at a particular time.
    - **Action** ➠ possible moves or decisions the agent can take in each state.
    - **Policy** ➠ strategy the agent uses to decide which action to take in a given state.
  - **RL Training Loop**
    - goal is to find a policy that will yield a lot of rewards for the agent.
    - optimal policy is learned through training by using algorithms like `Q learning or Deep Q learning`

### Deep Learning (DL)

- subset of ML that focuses on training `Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)` with multiple layers.
- automatically learns and extracts intricate representations and or features from raw and complex data.
- internal representation of data is built using extracted features and DL algorithms allow parallel processing of data leading to better scalability and performance.

- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

  - inspired by the human brain and consists of interconnected nodes called `neurons`.
  - **Building Blocks of ANN**

    - **Neurons** ➠ computational unit from an input that produces output.
    - **Weights** ➠ determines the strength of connection between the neurons.
    - **Activation Function** ➠ works on the weighted sum of inputs to a neuron and produces an output.
    - **Bias** ➠ additional input to a neuron that allows a certain degree of flexibility.
  - ANNs are trained using `backpropagation algorithm`.
    - **Backpropagation algorithm** ➠ adjusting the weights of neurons based on a calculation during training to correct errors in output.

  - **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**

    - type of sequential DL model that handles sequential data.
    - unlike `Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)`, allows information to persist using a `feedback loop.`
    - a key feature of RNN is the ability to maintain a `hidden state/memory` that is updated after each element in the input sequence is processed.
    - hidden state is used as the input for the network for the next time step allowing the model to capture dependencies and patterns across data spent across time.
    - RNNs do not perform well with capturing long term dependencies - due to `vanishing gradients` problem that can be addressed by using `Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)` models.
    - **Types of RNN**
      - **One-to-One** ➠ similar to feed forward neural network and not suitable for sequential data.
      - **One-to-Many** ➠ provides multiple output values for one input value. Use cases includes `music or sequence generation.`
      - **Many-to-One** ➠ provides one output value after receiving multiple input values. `e.g., sentiment analysis based on reviews.`
      - **Many-to-Many** ➠ provides multiple output values for multiple input values. `e.g., machine translation and entity recognition.`

  - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
    - works by using a `specialized memory cell and gating mechanisms` to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.
    - overcomes the vanishing gradients problem by `selectively remembering or forgetting information over time.`
    - **LSTM Workflow**
      - **Input Processing** ➠ inputs current data point in the sequence.
      - **Previous Memory** ➠ receives the previous hidden state values that represent what the system had remembered and forgot up to the current point in the sequence.
      - **Gating Mechanism** ➠ similar to filters that control the flow of information between cells in the system.
        - **Input Gate** ➠ decides what new information from the current input should be added to the memory cell.
        - **Forget Gate** ➠ decides what information in the current memory cell should be discarded or forgotten.
        - **Output Gate** ➠ regulates how much of the current memory cell should be exposed as the output of the current step.
      - **Updating Memory** ➠ updates the cell state by using information from both input and forget gate.
      - **Output Generation** ➠ LSTM uses the output to produce the current hidden state which becomes the output of the LSTM for the next time step.

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
  - type of DL model designed to process `grid-like data. e.g., images and videos.`
  - **CNN Layers**
    - **Input Layer** ➠ accepts images with height, width and depth representing RGB color channels.
    - **Feature Extraction Layers**
      - automatically learns and extracts relevant patterns and features from input images.
      - **Building Blocks**
        - **Convolutional Layer** ➠ applies convolutional operations to the input image using small filters called `kernels`.
        - **Activation Function** ➠ allows the network to learn more complex and non-linear relationships in the data.
        - **Pooling Layer** ➠ helps to reduce the computational complexity and spatial dimensions of the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers.
        - **Fully Connected Layer** ➠ responsible for making final predications or classifications based on the learned features.
        - **Softmax Layer** ➠ converts the output of the last fully connected layers to probability scores.
        - **Dropout Layer** ➠ regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in the network. Similar to that of a quality checker.
    - **Classification Layers** ➠ fully connected output layer where classification occurs.
  - **CNN Limitations**
    - requires massive data and computations.
    - subject to overfitting - happens with limited training data.
    - typically considered as black box models thereby difficult to interpret.
    - sensitive to small changes in the input leading to unstable predictions.
  - **CNN Applications**
    - image classification, object detection (draws bounding boxes around objects in an image)
    - perform pixel-level image segmentation.
    - face recognition tasks.
    - medical image diagnosis.
    - autonomous vehicle development (identify pedestrians, traffic signs and other vehicles)
