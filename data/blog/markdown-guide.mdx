##### **A quick overview of the markdown essentials** to get you up and running with markdown. Check out the links towards the end of this guide for more markdown features and further reading.

## Headers

```
Prefix h1 through h6 using # as shown below

# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6

(or) use = & - characters for h1 & h2 respectively

h1
=

h2
-
```

## Text manipulation

```
Italics -> wrap using * or _ character e.g., *Italic text* (or) _Italic text_

Bold text -> wrap using ** or __ e.g., **bold text** (or) __bold text__

Combination ->  **combining bold text and _italized text_**

Strikethrough -> wrap the word using two tildes e.g., ~~strikethrough text~~
```

### Footnotes

- Use `[^n]` after a word to insert a footnote - `n` is a numeric that lets you add multiple footnotes within a paragraph.
- Then use `[^n]: <insert footnote text>` to specify the footnote content - you can use `n` to your advantage here to link individual
  footnotes within a paragraph. See examples below.

```

## Horizontal rule

```
Use _ thrice to create a horizontal rule e.g., ___
```

## Unordered lists

Prefix list items using \* or - character. Use a single tab or indent to create a sub item.

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * sub item a
  * sub item b

(or)

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - sub item a
  - sub item b
```

### Ordered lists

Prefix list items using numbers (both sequential and non-sequential will work) Use double tabs or indents to create sub items.

```
1. Item 1
  * sub item a
  * sub item b
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

(or)

1. Item 1
  * sub item a
  * sub item b
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
```

### Task lists

An ordered or unordered list can be turned to a task list by adding one of the following patterns to the list item:

- `[ ]` for an incomplete or pending item and
- `[x]` for a completed item

```
- [x] Mow the lawn
- [x] Do the dishes
- [x] Wash car
- [ ] Hit the gym
```

### Blockquotes

Prefix blockquotes with > character. Use > twice in succession to create a blockquote within blockquote.

```
> this is a blockquote
>> this is a blockquote within a blockquote
```

### Hyperlinks

Use the full URL as is for a standard hyperlink. To use custom text with the hyperlink, wrap the custom text within [ ] and the
actual URL within ( )

```
Standard hyperlink -> http://www.google.com
Custom hyperlink -> [visit google](http://www.google.com)
```

### Images

```
![Alt text for image](image url)
e.g., ![placeholder image of size 600x400](https://placehold.co/600x400)
```

### Escape sequences

Use backlash to escape special characters. For example, asterisk is a special character used for a variety of operations like
making text bold, ordering lists etc. So, how do you render the asterisk character itself in markdown?

```
render asterisk in markdown via escape sequence -> how do i render \* character?

\ escape sequence works with most of the special characters like \ ` * _ { } [ ] ( ) # + - . !
```

### Code blocks

Wrap code blocks using backticks e.g., \`alert('hello there!')`

For a code block spanning multiple lines, use fenced code blocks by wrapping the code block using three backticks (or) tilde
character. You cannot mix ` and ~ together in the code block - use just one.

````
``` or ~~~
function alert(name) {
  alert(`Hello ${name}. Nice to meet you!`);
}
``` or ~~~
````

Specify the language name and if required, a filename within code blocks for syntax highlighting. Notice how both
the functions only differ in syntax highlighting.

```js:greet.js
function alert(name) {
  alert(`Hello ${name}. Nice to meet you!`)
}
```

### Tables

- Use - character to separate table head from table body
- Use | character to separate table columns
- Use : along with - character to align table columns
  - e.g., center align column --> :----:
  - right align column --> ----:

```
| Item  | Qty | Price |
| ----- | :-: | ----: |
| Bread |  2  | $4.50 |
| Milk  |  1  | $3.99 |
| Eggs  |  3  | $5.25 |
```

| Item  | Qty | Price |
| ----- | :-: | ----: |
| Bread |  2  | $4.50 |
| Milk  |  1  | $3.99 |
| Eggs  |  3  | $5.25 |
